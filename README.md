## Testing Tracking Service 
To test Tracking service you can use wscat (install via npm). 
The following commands can be used to test.
- Subscribe as an employee: 
````
wscat -c "ws://localhost:5057/tracking/ws?employeeId=6286f2e0-f19a-4d93-b70e-10af78642f62"
````

- Subscribe to a specific employee as a user
````
wscat -c "ws://localhost:5057/tracking/ws?userId=409a2b0c-0bfa-459c-b782-82a914bec178&employeeId=6286f2e0-f19a-4d93-b70e-10af78642f62"
````

If employee has not started subscribing, a user won't be able to subscribe to him.
